Random tree is ultilized in my random forest implementation. One random attribute will be selected to split a tree node. Two samples will be randomly selected and their mean value of the selected attribute will be used as spliting threshold. This methodology is originally proposed in [1]. No max tree depth specified. Tree size controlled by max leaf size. This method runs super fast and performance is comparable to other entropy based splitting method.

The estimated OOB is 0.8822 with 100 trees and leaf size equals 1
